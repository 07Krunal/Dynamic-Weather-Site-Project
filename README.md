# Dynamic-Weather-Site-Project
This is a dynamic weather website using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. It uses the location coordinates from the browser data and sends the same in the request to the Openweather map API. In the response it receives the weekly weather data daywise. The same is displayed on the UI.
